# Prognostic-Predictions-post-Cardiac-Arrest
Predicted patient’s neurological outcome within 10 hours after resuscitation using an ensemble model of ANN and Xgb. Employed a twin model approach, one with emphasis on interpretability using Xgboost + Shap values and the other with emphasis on boosting sensitivity using a CNN-LSTM architecture.Identified new predictors from the patients qEEG signals that aids physician’s decision on withdrawal of life support which improved sensitivity from 36% to 71% with a 100% specificity
